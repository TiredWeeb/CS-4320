I will be looking into Edward Snowden's release of Top Secret information about National Security Administration security and surveillance practices. Edward Snowden’s release of Top Secret information resulted in him being charged with two counts of violating the Espionage Act resulting in 30 years in prison. This was because the data he leaked showed that the National Security Administration had been secretly collecting data from multiple Americans by tapping into internet servers from nine companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple. This showed a surprising lack of security and privacy by the companies whose servers were being tapped into which damaged both their and the NSA’s integrity.


Due to the insane amount of Americans on social media the consequences of this were insane. Social media users had their privacy violated by having all of the data they had that was collected leaked. This could/may have ended up violating their safety and integrity based on the contents of these messages/calls. Even more dangerously spies of the NSA and their allies had their safehouses where they could stay leaked putting them at insane risk considering even our enemies at the time had seen the leaks. Any one of them may have ended up dead due to this.
